## Challenges and Learnings

Building a backend for AI-driven workflows meant handling asynchronous tasks, user-generated content, and performance-sensitive endpoints. Implementing secure authentication with extensibility in mind was a key early challenge. Later, coordinating across developers taught me the importance of architectural clarity, consistent code review practices, and proactive monitoring.

## Outcome

ApolloApp launched with a stable backend that supports dynamic AI features and user workflows. My contributions ensured secure access, reliable infrastructure, and maintainable code—while my coordination role helped streamline development and deployment across the team.
